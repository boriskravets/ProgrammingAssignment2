## My functions do almost the same thing as sample functions in the Assignment do.
## Difference is using matrix instead of the vector and 'solve()' instead of 'mean()'

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
